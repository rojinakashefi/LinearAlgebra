# Shadow creation using shear transformation

This projects help us to create shadow of image using transformation. For implementing this task we have four sub tasks :

1. Load our image using matplotlib or pillow library

2. Create a shadow 
   
   In this step we need to expand the initial photo since in next step (transformation) may get out  of the border.

3. Apply transformation on created shadow.

4. Merge initial photo with transformed shadow.

   For learning transformation here is [my notes](https://github.com/rojinakashefi/Intro-to-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/main/linear%20algebra/shadow%20creation%20using%20shear%20transformation/linear%20transformation.pdf).
